While the disease can be caused by mutations in any of the genes involved in the Hirschsprung disease gene cluster, the most common genetic mutations are those that affect the expression of the gene encoding the protein that forms the intestinal wall. These mutations can occur at any point in the gene's sequence, and they can affect the function of the protein in any location of the intestine.","Coding sequence mutations in RET, GDNF, EDNRB, EDN3, and SOX10 are involved in the development of Hirschsprung disease.

22,"Transcription and splicing are two separate processes that occur in the cell nucleus. Transcription involves the addition of nucleotides to the growing ribosome, which is a small molecule that carries the genetic information for the cell. Splicing, on the other hand, involves the removal of non-coding regions of the DNA to produce mature RNA.
Transcription and splicing are often confused as they are similar in appearance, but they are actually distinct processes. Transcription occurs in the cytoplasm, while splicing occurs in the nucleus. Transcription involves the addition of nucleotides to the growing ribosome, while splicing involves the removal of non-coding regions of the DNA.
Transcription is essential for the synthesis of messenger RNA (mRNA), which is the precursor to protein synthesis. Once the mRNA is translated into protein, it is used as a template for the synthesis of other mRNA molecules. Splicing is essential for the production of specific protein products from the mRNA.
The process of splicing occurs in the nucleus, where the ribosome is located. Splicing is a process of removing the non-coding regions of the DNA to produce the mature mRNA product. The removal of non-coding regions occurs through the formation of a snip, where the mRNA molecule is cleaved at the 5' end by a ribonucleoprotein complex.
The splicing enzyme, S100, is involved in the removal of non-coding regions from the mRNA. This enzyme is located in the nucleus and is activated by the binding of the ribosome to the 5' end of the mRNA. Once the ribosome is bound to the 5' end, S100 is activated and begins to cleave the mRNA.
The resulting mature mRNA product is then transported to the cytoplasm for protein synthesis. The removal of non-coding regions of the DNA during splicing is necessary for the production of specific proteins, as the ribosome must have a clear and defined","Yes. There is strong evidence that splicing and transcription are intimately coupled in metazoans, with  genome wide surveys show that most splicing occurs during transcription.

Reasoning:
The GLI2 gene is a member of the GLI family of transcription factors. Mutations in this gene have been associated with several human diseases, including craniosynostosis, which is a condition characterized by premature closure of the skull bones. In craniosynostosis, the skull bones (suture) do not fully fuse, leading to abnormal facial structure and increased risk of brain and spinal cord development. The GLI2 gene encodes a transcription factor that regulates gene expression in the brain, including genes involved in development and regulation of the nervous system. Mutations in this gene have been linked to several other human genes, including DLX5, PTEN, and TSC2. However, the GLI2 gene is the most commonly associated with craniosynostosis, with several mutations in this gene being associated with the condition.","The genes that are most commonly linked to craniosynostoses are the members of the Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor family FGFR3 and to a lesser extent FGFR1 and FGFR2.

The transcription factor EGR1 is a member of the ETS family of transcription factors that share a common DNA-binding domain. It is known to be involved in regulating several cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis.
In the context of lysosomal genes, EGR1 regulates the expression of genes encoding enzymes involved in lysosomal catabolism, such as cathepsins, lysosomal membrane proteins, and lysosomal enzymes. For instance, EGR1 promotes the expression of genes involved in lysosomal acidification, such as the lysosomal acidic protein, Lamp2, and the lysosomal carboxypeptidase, Lamp1.
Furthermore, EGR1 regulates the expression of genes involved in lysosomal vesicle formation, such as the lysosomal membrane protein, Lamp4, and the lysosomal vesicle glycoprotein, Lamp5. These genes are involved in the formation of lysosomal vesicles, which are essential for the transport and degradation of cellular waste.
Overall, EGR1 is a critical regulator of lysosomal gene expression, playing a crucial role in the regulation of lysosomal homeostasis and the maintenance of cell homeostasis.","Transcription factor EB (TFEB) is a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy, driving lysosome adaptation to environmental cues, such as starvation, and therefore targeting of TFEB may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for modulating lysosomal function in human disease.",20,No answer generated,"[23609508, 22343943, 23604321, 23393155, 21804531, 22547675, 23524842, 30295802, 21042593, 9214638, 8063775, 14767561, 15345721, 24047559, 24278483, 12934068, 23401004, 12202480, 25060788, 28837371]","[23604321, 23393155, 23609508, 25315655, 22343943, 23830905, 23524842, 23401004, 21617040, 21804531, 25605940, 25060788, 23457305, 21752829, 25750174]",8,15,0.5333333333333333
