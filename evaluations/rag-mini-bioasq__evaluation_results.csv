97,Which pathological condition of the heart is known as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)?,"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) has been recently recognized as the most common inherited cardiovascular disorder, affecting 1 in 500 adults worldwide. HCM is characterized by myocyte hypertrophy resulting in thickening of the ventricular wall, myocyte disarray, interstitial and/or replacement fibrosis, decreased ventricular cavity volume and diastolic dysfunction. HCM is also the most common cause of sudden death in the young particularly among athletes. A large proportion of patients diagnosed with HCM have mutations in sarcomeric proteins. HCM is the most prevalent genetic disorder affecting the heart and is typically inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Adults with cardiomyopathy suffer SCD or adverse events such as stroke and heart failure from HCM.",20,No answer generated,"[21160605, 25191275, 22348519, 25044876, 11886323, 25081404, 25328416, 19575162, 21507890, 22874472, 20339815, 25228955, 7788945, 20079992, 17961794, 17602984, 22846097, 23782526, 25309450, 21498307]","[25328416, 25209314, 22665960, 25309450, 25191275, 25044876, 21507890, 25228955, 25081404, 23782526]",8,10,0.8

The known genetic causes are a microdeletion at 16p13.3 or mutations or deletions of the cAMP-response element binding protein-BP (CREBBP) (50-60% of the cases) and of the homologous gene E1A-binding protein (EP300) at 22q13 (5%). Direct sequencing of CREBBP performed in 13 RSTS patients identified the three zinc fingers (CH1, CH2, CH3) and HAT domain as mutational hotspots. Thus about 55% of patients have cytogenetic or molecular abnormalities in the Crebbp or E1A binding protein p300 (Ep300) gene, leaving the diagnosis in 45% of patients to rest on clinical features only.",20,No answer generated,"[22303793, 20125191, 22991675, 7630403, 20101707, 18773673, 14974086, 12107442, 23239541, 3362213, 8606626, 20882035, 24521565, 22183150, 8460633, 15875219, 9467007, 9215678, 22193623, 22090721]","[7630403, 16359492, 22269667, 14974086, 18773673, 20684013, 23432975, 22303793, 15706485, 20689175, 22991675]",5,11,0.45454545454545453
