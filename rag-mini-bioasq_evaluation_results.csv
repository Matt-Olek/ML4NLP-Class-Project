A critical question is why only the homozygous loss of SMN1, and not SMN2, results in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). H4F5 is also highly deleted in type I SMA chromosomes, and thus is a candidate phenotypic modifier for SMA.

For this purpose, gene fusion events may be used as the sole evidence or as independent information combined with other 'genome-aware' or similarity-based methods, and functional association may be predicted at different levels.

273,What is the Barr body?,"The Barr body is the inactive X chromosome in a female somatic cell. It is readily identified as plano-convex structure of 2-3 micron in diameter on the periphery of the nuclear membrane.   One of the X-chromosomes by a random inactivation process condenses to form X-chromatin (Barr body) in early embryonic life. Once this occurs, it is final and fixed for that cell and all its descendants (1,2).  Barr body is an inactivated X chromosome in the normal female somatic cell. Inactivation of these chromosomes is known as Lyonization. Lyonization has both genetic and clinical significance. Barr body can be easily identified with ordinary stains. It also helps in identifying the sex of an individual when used judiciously.   The Barr body has long been recognized as the cytological manifestation of the inactive X chromosome (Xi) in interphase nuclei. Despite being known for over 50 years, relatively few components of the Barr body have been identified.

OBJECTIVE: CT-011 is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that modulates the immune response through interaction with PD-1, a protein belonging to the B7 receptor family present on lymphocytes. The objectives of this phase I study were to assess the dose-limiting toxicities, to determine the maximum tolerated dose, and to study the pharmacokinetics of CT-011 administered once to patients with advanced hematologic malignancies. We have developed a cancer vaccine in which autologous tumor is fused with dendritic cells resulting in the presentation of tumor antigens in the context of DC-mediated costimulation. The median t1/2 of CT-011 ranged from 217 to 410 hours. The PD1/PDL1 pathway is an important element contributing to tumor-mediated immune suppression. The recent approval of the CTLA-4-blocking antibody ipilimumab for the treatment of melanoma was a watershed event, opening up a new era in the field of immunotherapy.

325,How does ranolazine affect calcium handling in the heart,"Ranolazine has only a small effect on the basal calcium current, while it greatly affects whole cell calcium current when facilitated by beta-adrenoceptor or histamine receptor activation.
Ranolazine is a novel agent that inhibits the late sodium current thereby reducing cellular sodium and calcium overload.
Ranolazine reduces Ca2+ overload and LV mechanical dysfunction during ischemia/reperfusion.
ranolazine decreases  I(Na,L)-induced dysregulation of calcium cycling that contributes to the antiarrhythmic actions of this agent.
ranolazine desensitizes Ca(2+)-dependent RyR2 activation, and inhibits Ca(i) oscillations.
ranolazine ameliorates the Ca(2+) response and cross-bridge kinetics of cardiac myofilaments.",20,No answer generated,"[20924097, 18439620, 17220471, 19333133, 19403851, 23096376, 7873471, 22709755, 8735623, 23271797, 19752362, 22879384, 23247666, 17467634, 16781216, 22343711, 7889444, 21538388, 19675298, 10404034]","[22245792, 16781216, 19675298, 20924097, 18439620, 21741479, 8735623, 17027025, 23247666, 16775092, 23271797, 17220471, 22879384, 23596505, 22709755, 22343711]",11,16,0.6875
326,Which is the primary distinction between the Reverse Warburg effect and the conventional Warburg effect?,"The conventional ""Warburg effect"" reffers to  the metabolic shift of cancer cells towards aerobic glycolysis, due to mitochondrial dysfunction. The ""reverse Warburg effect"" or ""parasitic"" energy-transfer, is a model of ""two-compartment tumor metabolism"". In this model, cancer cells secrete hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), initiating oxidative stress and aerobic glycolysis in the tumor stroma. The cancer-associated fibroblasts of the stroma are glycolytic and lack detectable mitochondria. These glycolytic stromal cells produce mitochondrial fuels (L-lactate, ketone bodies and chemical building blocks, such as amino acids -glutamine-, and nucleotides) that are then transferred to oxidative epithelial cancer cells. Lactate and ketones drive cancer cell  oxidative mitochondrial metabolism (OXPHOS), and building blocks sustain the anabolic needs of rapidly proliferating cancer cells. Therefore, according to the ""reverse Warburg effect"", stromal catabolism fuels anabolic tumor growth via energy transfer. Thus, in ""reverse Warburg effect"" the cancer-associated fibroblasts of the stroma undergo aerobic glycolysis, rather than epithelial cancer cells themselves, as proposed by the conventional ""Warburg effect"".",20,No answer generated,"[25197670, 19923890, 19289479, 3146524, 24594496, 22313602, 10407891, 21762783, 23796193, 25503672, 14960500, 21705748, 2497685, 15375129, 22563263, 28581074, 12468094, 2497684, 11437309, 20724379]","[22313602, 20495363, 23443971, 25197670, 21558814, 22395432, 22236875, 21300172, 21778829, 23388463, 19923890, 21521946, 23844381, 20818174, 20562527]",3,15,0.2

Decreased AMPK activity and the subsequent reduction in cardiac autophagy are central to the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy.  In fact, dissociation of Bcl-2 from Beclin1 may be an important mechanism for preventing diabetic cardiomyopathy via AMPK activation that restores autophagy and protects against cardiac apoptosis. In addition, genetic inhibition of AMPK in cardiomyocytes attenuates cardiac autophagy, exacerbates cardiac dysfunction and increases mortality in diabetic mice. The modulation of AT-1R/AMPK-MAPK pathway might play crucial roles for the pathogenesis of diabetic cardiomyopathy and it could become an important therapeutic target to ameliorate the diabetic cardiomyopathy.

Despite the presence of over 3 million transposons separated on average by approximately 500 bp, the human and mouse genomes each contain almost 1000 transposon-free regions (TFRs) over 10 kb in length. The majority of human TFRs correlate with orthologous TFRs in the mouse, despite the fact that most transposons are lineage specific. Many human TFRs also overlap with orthologous TFRs in the marsupial opossum, indicating that these regions have remained refractory to transposon insertion for long evolutionary periods. Over 90% of the bases covered by TFRs are noncoding, much of which is not highly conserved. Most TFRs are not associated with unusual nucleotide composition, but are significantly associated with genes encoding developmental regulators, suggesting that they represent extended regions of regulatory information that are largely unable to tolerate insertions, a conclusion difficult to reconcile with current conceptions of gene regulation.",20,No answer generated,"[18093339, 26527719, 20532223, 2165587, 19324900, 22691070, 23358416, 17653590, 16859531, 26818075, 12615002, 16717285, 16857058, 22242120, 20502635, 6572942, 17591602, 28212378, 9204548, 28138849]","[21515576, 16365385, 18093339]",1,3,0.3333333333333333

422,How effective is the dentritic cells treatment on cancer?,"Another approach to cancer therapy takes advantage of the normal role of the dendritic cell as an immune educator. Dendritic cells grab antigens from viruses, bacteria, or other organisms and wave them at T cells to recruit their help in an initial T cell immune response. This works well against foreign cells that enter the body, but cancer cells often evade the self/non-self detection system. By modifying dendritic cells, researchers are able to trigger a special kind of autoimmune response that includes a T cell attack of the cancer cells. Because a cancer antigen alone is not enough to rally the immune troops, scientists first fuse a cytokine to a tumor antigen with the hope that this will send a strong antigenic signal. Next, they grow a patient's dendritic cells in the incubator and let them take up this fused cytokine-tumor antigen. This enables the dendritic cells to mature and eventually display the same tumor antigens as appear on the patient's cancer cells. When these special mature dendritic cells are given back to the patient, they wave their newly acquired tumor antigens at the patient's immune system, and those T cells that can respond mount an attack on the patient's cancer cells.",20,No answer generated,"[11022098, 27573048, 23619122, 22230748, 28341752, 21049281, 26824195, 26566923, 10963459, 27556661, 23880267, 26548600, 24312415, 32908163, 23229276, 23621620, 21496667, 28866747, 24555979, 34515617]","[20811715, 22042118, 23684423, 23369287, 19968878, 16221071, 17986000, 11022098, 21895989, 11570584, 22230748, 18684638]",2,12,0.16666666666666666

437,Is there a role for the cylindromatosis tumor suppressor (CYLD) in lung cancer?,"To explore a correlation between CYLD expression and responsiveness to TRAIL in lung cancer cell lines, we established lung cancer cell lines that stably express CYLD. Our data provided the first evidence that increased expression of CYLD directly blocks TRAIL-induced NF - B activation, and consequently increases TRAIL-induced apoptosis in lung cancer cells. CYLD may act as a therapeutic target of lung cancer. Targeting CYLD, in combination with TRAIL, may be a new strategy to treat lung cancer with high NF - B activity. Cyld encodes a 956-amino acid deubiquitinating enzyme, which is a negative regulator of nuclear factor kappaB and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. Mutations that truncate and inactivate the carboxyl-terminal deubiquitinating domain of CYLD underlie the development of skin appendage tumors in humans, whereas down-regulation of Cyld expression has been associated with the development of various types of human malignancies including lung cancer. To establish an animal model of human CYLD inactivation and characterize the biological role of CYLD in vivo, we generated mice carrying a homozygous deletion of Cyld exon 9 mice ) using a conditional approach. Our study identifies an important role of CYLD in lung maturation, which may underlie the development of many cases of lung cancer.

This phenomenon, first described by Zimmerman and Hulsmann, was termed the ""calcium paradox"". This phenomenon is concomitant with a rapid consumption of myocardial high-energy phosphate stores. The Ca(2+) paradox represents a good model to study Ca(2+) overload injury in ischemic heart diseases. The Ca(2+) paradox can be elicited by perfusing isolated hearts with Ca(2+)-free media for 3 min or 5 min followed by 30 min of Ca(2+) repletion. A possible mechanism for the 'calcium paradox' is that exposure to a calcium-free medium removes extracellular calcium rendering the sarcolemma more permeable to calcium. On calcium repletion, cell injury is triggered by calcium influx. Cardiac dysfunction due to Ca2+ -paradox may be associated with apoptosis.",20,No answer generated,"[6823106, 6626051, 24289081, 23284963, 28496833, 22198507, 6180691, 19423954, 7889444, 19675298, 22733215, 19068246, 11334832, 10779321, 10824732, 17214508, 15556149, 21135804, 15110149, 23123322]","[6823106, 6626051, 16901476, 23284963, 3117031, 4058248, 1031954, 2720439, 24289081]",4,9,0.4444444444444444

489,What is the role of lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) in hematopoiesis?,"LSD1 represents a central regulator of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. LSD1 knockdown (LSD1-kd) expanded progenitor numbers by enhancing their proliferative behavior. LSD1-kd led to an extensive expansion of granulomonocytic, erythroid and megakaryocytic progenitors. In contrast, terminal granulopoiesis, erythropoiesis and platelet production were severely inhibited. The only exception was monopoiesis, which was promoted by LSD1 deficiency. Importantly, we showed that peripheral blood granulocytopenia, monocytosis, anemia and thrombocytopenia were reversible after LSD1-kd termination. Extramedullary splenic hematopoiesis contributed to the phenotypic reversion, and progenitor populations remained expanded. LSD1-kd was associated with the upregulation of key hematopoietic genes, including Gfi1b, Hoxa9 and Meis1, which are known regulators of the HSC/progenitor compartment. We also demonstrated that LSD1-kd abrogated Gfi1b-negative autoregulation by crossing LSD1-kd with Gfi1b:GFP mice. There is also epigenetic regulation of hematopoietic differentiation by Gfi-1 and Gfi-1b that is mediated by the cofactors CoREST and LSD1. A short Gfi-1B isoform controls erythroid differentiation by recruiting the LSD1-CoREST complex through the dimethylation of its SNAG domain. The enzymatic domain of LSD1 plays an important role in repressing the TAL1-directed transcription of GAL4 reporter linked to a thymidine kniase minimal promoter. Furthermore,  the TAL1-associated LSD1, HDAC1, and their enzymatic activities are coordinately down-regulated during the early phases of erythroid differentiation. Consistent with the rapid changes of TAL1-corepressor complex during differentiation, TAL1 recruits LSD1 to the silenced p4.2 promoter in undifferentiated, but not in differentiated, murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells. ShRNA-mediated knockdown of LSD1 in MEL cells resulted in derepression of the TAL1 target gene accompanied by increasing dimeH3K4 at the promoter region. Thus, it appears that histone lysine demethylase LSD1 may negatively regulate TAL1-mediated transcription and that the dynamic regulation of TAL1-associated LSD1/HDAC1 complex may determine the onset of erythroid differentiation programs. Furthermore, RUNX1 has been shown to be part of a large transcription factor complex, together with LDB1, GATA1, TAL1, and ETO2 in erythroid cells. RUNX1 interacts with LSD1 and MYEF2 in erythroid cells. MYEF2 is bound in undifferentiated cells and is lost upon differentiation, whereas LSD1 is bound in differentiated cells. Finally, LSD1 also participates in the trans-repressive effects of SALL4. Based on luciferase assays, the amine oxidase domain of LSD1 is important in suppressing SALL4-mediated reporter transcription. In freshly isolated adult mouse bone marrows, both SALL4 and LSD1 proteins are preferentially expressed in undifferentiated progenitor cells and co-localize in the nuclei. Further sequential chromatin immunoprecipitation assay confirmed that these two factors share the same binding sites at the promoter regions of important hematopoietic regulatory genes including EBF1, GATA1, and TNF.",20,No answer generated,"[23795291, 22699452, 24163373, 30344952, 22310283, 19736520, 23396445, 17577921, 17707228, 22420752, 23022380, 21947282, 21940714, 23408854, 20720541, 23085465, 22885124, 16963560, 18511943, 23147254]","[19497860, 19736520, 22310283, 24163373, 17707228, 22399799, 22699452, 22801375]",5,8,0.625

At present, de novo cardiomyocytes can be generated either in vitro, using directed differentiation of embryonic stem cells or induced pluripotent stem cells, or in vivo via direct reprogramming of resident adult cardiac fibroblast or ectopic stimulation of resident cardiac stem or progenitor cells. The production of human cardiac progenitor cells and cardiomyocytes from human pluripotent stem cells provides an amenable source of cells for applications in drug discovery, disease modeling, regenerative medicine, and cardiotoxicity screening. In addition, the ability to derive human-induced pluripotent stem cells from somatic tissues, combined with current high-throughput screening and pharmacogenomics, may help realize the use of these cells to fulfill the potential of personalized medicine. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) provide a unique opportunity to study ""disease in a dish"" within a defined genetic and environmental background. Patient-derived iPSCs have been successfully used to model cardiomyopathies, rhythm disorders and vascular disorders. Long-QT syndrome and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia are two heart rhythm disorders that have been already successfully modeled by several groups using this approach, which will likely serve to model other mono- or polygenetic cardiovascular disorders in the future.

Furthermore, in an animal model of myocardial infarction, intracoronary administration of IGF-1 is shown to reduce pathological cardiac remodeling, induce myocardial regeneration, and improve ventricular function. IGF-1 is a potent modulator of stem cell replication, commitment to the myocyte lineage, and myocyte differentiation. In another study, the dual delivery of IGF-1 and HGF from affinity-binding alginate biomaterial prevented cell apoptosis, induced cardiomyocyte cell cycle re-entry and increased the incidence of GATA-4-positive cell clusters. The addition of nanofiber-mediated IGF-1 delivery to Cardiac Progenitor Cells therapy improved in part the recovery of myocardial structure and function after infarction. IGF-1 promotes proliferation and survival of CPCs.

559,What is known about Vancomycin dosing in neonates?,"Staphylococcus epidermis, including methicillin-resistant strains, are inhibited by vancomycin concentrations of 1-4 µg/ml. 
Staphylococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumonia, and Streptococcus viridans are susceptible to 2 µg/ml vancomycin. 
Bacillus spp. are inhibited by 2 µg/ml, Corynebacterium spp. by 0.04-3.1 µg/ml and Clostridium spp. by 0.39-6 µg/ml vancomycin. 
Peak and trough concentrations of vancomycin should be 40 μg/ml and 10 μg/ml, respectively, to both be effective and avoid oto- or nephrotoxicity in adults. There is no ideal pattern of vancomycin dosing; vancomycin dosages must be individualized. Because vancomycin activity is primarily time-dependent, the 24-h area under the curve (AUC0-24h) divided by the minimum inhibitor concentration (MIC) value (AUC0-24h/MIC) is a better predictor of efficacy. In adults with MIC values less than 1 μg/ml, trough concentrations greater than 10 µg/ml result in AUC0-24h/MIC values 400
Compared with adults, neonates have a higher extracellular fluid volume and a limited renal elimination capacity resulting in different pharmacokinetics subject to maturation stage.  Infants weighing less than 1,000 gm had significantly larger volumes of drug distribution and consequently longer drug half-lives than larger premature infants, regardless of postconceptual or actual age. These differences alter the vancomycin dosing recommendations in these two groups of premature infants.
Vancomycin-associated nephrotoxicity is rare in neonates, even with serum peak concentrations 40 microg/mL. Vancomycin is associated with ototoxicity.
There is no consensus on vancomycin dosing in newborns and young infants, which leads to significant variation in vancomycin dosing regimens and TDM guidance across neonatal units.

583,"What are the main characteristics/symptoms of the ""Brugada"" syndrome","In 1992, Brugada and Brugada first described a new entity, which became known as Brugada syndrome, that is associated with a high risk of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death in patients without structural heart disease. This syndrome is characterized by a distinct electrocardiographic phenotype, type 1 Brugada pattern, consisting of a coved ST-segment elevation (≥0.2 mV) followed by a negative T wave in more than one right precordial lead. The typical Brugada electrocardiogram (ECG) phenotype is often concealed in affected population. Brugada syndrome is a genetically determined familial disease with autosomal dominant transmission and variable penetrance, conferring a predisposition to sudden cardiac death due to ventricular arrhythmias. Brugada syndrome (BrS)is considered to be a primary inherited channelopathy often involving the inward sodium current and the diagnosis has traditionally required the exclusion of overt structural heart disease.

585,How does thyroid hormone regulate mitochondrial biogenesis in the myocardium?,"T4 increases myocardial mitochondrial bioenergetic capacity, oxygen consumption and markers of mitochondrial biogenesis. The marked, parallel increases in PPARalpha levels suggest its potential involvement in mediating myocardial-specific remodeling of mitochondria in response to T4.  T3 induces mitochondrial biogenesis. In fact, T3 treatment for 72h  increases activity of respiratory complexes II, IV, V and citrate synthase (CS), levels of mitochondrial enzyme subunits (e.g. COXI, COXIV) and nuclear-encoded transcription factors, involved in mitochondrial biogenesis (e.g. PGC-1, mtTFA and PPAR-alpha).  Furthermore, L-T3 increases  the expression of factors involved in mitochondrial DNA transcription and biogenesis, such as hypoxic inducible factor-1α, mitochondrial transcription factor A and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ coactivator-1α, in the LV peri-infarct zone.
The activation of TFAM and TFB2M expression is shown to be required for the induction of mtDNA biogenesis by T3. Truncated forms of the nuclear receptor TRα1, with molecular weights of 43 kDa (p43) and 28 Kda have been previously identified in mitochondria. P43 is a mitochondrial T3 receptor which stimulates mitochondrial transcription and protein synthesis in the presence of T3. p43 depletion in mice decreases mitochondrial DNA replication and respiratory chain activity.",20,No answer generated,"[15543939, 15893763, 21568860, 19036942, 2773621, 7556180, 1321044, 21568669, 215035, 17893267, 18430565, 20515651, 19951746, 20232113, 12388124, 16595628, 18221125, 22109994, 23762386, 1331777]","[12734114, 15543939, 15893763, 20515651, 22109994, 18575627, 21914860, 19036942, 6157679, 17962579, 19462004, 2773621, 7556180, 21568860, 1321044, 20100314, 215035, 12388124]",11,18,0.6111111111111112

593,What is Snord116?,"SNORD116 is a small nucleolar (sno) RNA gene cluster (HBII-85) implicated as a major contributor the Prader-Willi phenotype. 
SNORD116 genes appears to be responsible for the major features of PWS. 
SNORD116 is a paternally expressed box C/D snoRNA gene cluster.
The mouse C/D box snoRNA MBII-85 (SNORD116) is processed into at least five shorter RNAs using processing sites near known functional elements of C/D box snoRNAs.
Snord116 expression in the medial hypothalamus, particularly within nuclei that are part of feeding circuitry. High expression of Snord116 was evident in the paraventricular (PVN) and ventromedial (VMH) nuclei, but particularly prevalent in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) according to in situ hybridization. Snord116 expression level in ventral hypothalamic dissections including ARC was significantly greater (by 2-fold) than that in cortex; and its expression level in dorsal hypothalamic dissections including PVN was double that in cortex. The enhanced expression pattern of Snord116 in hypothalamic nuclei was observed at weaning and young adult stages, but less obvious neonatally when expression was significantly more widespread. Therefore the expression of Snord116 likely is regulated developmentally.
Snord116del mice with paternally derived deletion lack expression of this snoRNA. They have early-onset postnatal growth deficiency, but normal fertility and lifespan. While pituitary structure and somatotrophs are normal, liver Igf1 mRNA is decreased. In cognitive and behavior tests, Snord116del mice are deficient in motor learning and have increased anxiety. Around three months of age, they develop hyperphagia, but stay lean on regular and high-fat diet. On reduced caloric intake, Snord116del mice maintain their weight better than wild-type littermates, excluding increased energy requirement as a cause of hyperphagia. Normal compensatory feeding after fasting, and ability to maintain body temperature in the cold indicate normal energy homeostasis regulation. Metabolic chamber studies reveal that Snord116del mice maintain energy homeostasis by altered fuel usage. Prolonged mealtime and increased circulating ghrelin indicate a defect in meal termination mechanism. Snord116del mice, the first snoRNA deletion animal model, reveal a novel role for a non-coding RNA in growth and feeding regulation.",20,No answer generated,"[22495932, 24311433, 7774322, 20588305, 8178007, 2654251, 20602044, 16924389, 10037251, 24379556, 9585042, 31196834, 11823453, 18692402, 19205523, 12093966, 15279074, 30040876, 17697873, 29137239]","[24311433, 22694955, 20803659, 22664655, 21880592, 20588305, 22495932, 18320030]",3,8,0.375

609,What is transvection?,"An unusual feature of the Diptera is that homologous chromosomes are intimately synapsed in somatic cells. At a number of loci in Drosophila, this pairing can significantly influence gene expression. Such influences were first detected within the bithorax complex (BX-C) by E.B. Lewis, who coined the term transvection to describe them. Most cases of transvection involve the action of enhancers in trans. At several loci deletion of the promoter greatly increases this action in trans, suggesting that enhancers are normally tethered in cis by the promoter region. Transvection can also occur by the action of silencers in trans or by the spreading of position effect variegation from rearrangements having heterochromatic breakpoints to paired unrearranged chromosomes. Although not demonstrated, other cases of transvection may involve the production of joint RNAs by trans-splicing. Several cases of transvection require Zeste, a DNA-binding protein that is thought to facilitate homolog interactions by self-aggregation. Genes showing transvection can differ greatly in their response to pairing disruption. In several cases, transvection appears to require intimate synapsis of homologs. However, in at least one case (transvection of the iab-5,6,7 region of the BX-C), transvection is independent of synapsis within and surrounding the interacting gene. The latter example suggests that transvection could well occur in organisms that lack somatic pairing. In support of this, transvection-like phenomena have been described in a number of different organisms, including plants, fungi, and mammals.",20,No answer generated,"[2505416, 2238088, 25353823, 25755186, 1979484, 16317716, 23523158, 8827557, 32154838, 34755081, 12520035, 8813311, 2533403, 28734578, 32901611, 18002454, 2970919, 23094889, 24263003, 20972574]","[11931232, 12429702, 2238088, 3135240, 2505416, 11504843, 9348657, 10322135, 1979484]",3,9,0.3333333333333333

669,How does phospholamban affect the biological activity of the calcium ATPase SERCA?,"SR calcium uptake is mediated by a Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA2), whose activity is reversibly regulated by phospholamban (PLN). Dephosphorylated PLN is an inhibitor of SERCA and phosphorylation of PLN relieves this inhibition. Phospholamban (PLN) is a small integral membrane protein, which binds and inhibits in a yet unknown fashion the Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Based on structural and dynamics data, a model in which PLN undergoes allosteric activation upon encountering SERCA has been proposed. The allosteric regulation of SERCA depends on the conformational equilibrium of PLN, whose cytoplasmic regulatory domain interconverts between three different states: a ground T state (helical and membrane associated), an excited R state (unfolded and membrane detached), and a B state (extended and enzyme-bound), which is noninhibitory. Phosphorylation of PLN shifts the populations toward the B state, increasing SERCA activity. Phospholamban (PLN) regulates cardiac contractility via its modulation of sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) activity. Impairment of this regulatory process causes heart failure.",20,No answer generated,"[19708671, 19948724, 22707725, 15909986, 15134458, 8702967, 19158349, 12589804, 11854448, 22971924, 19840770, 10555147, 9182523, 11559781, 21266500, 15781867, 3957897, 18508637, 16564056, 21282613]","[22679139, 15781867, 21576492, 24101520, 23308118, 19708671]",2,6,0.3333333333333333

690,Are retroviruses used for gene therapy?,"Gene therapy is one of the most promising and active fields in therapeutic research. Gene therapy is a treatment option that introduces genetic material in vivo or ex vivo into the cells of an affected organism in order to: exchange a defective gene; manipulate a disease-related gene; or introduce an additional gene copy for overexpression of the encoded protein to generate a curative biological effect. Somatic gene therapy is gene transfer by a specific vector to a somatic cell; in contrast to germline gene therapy, the modification of the cell is restricted to the recipient and cannot be passed to her/his progeny. High efficiency of gene transfer, high specificity for the target cells, long-lasting expression of the transgene and safety without adverse reactions are the desired characteristics of an ideal vector for gene transfer.
Retroviral (gretroviral and lentiviral) vectors have now been used in more than 350 gene-therapy studies. Retroviral vectors are particularly suited for gene-correction of cells due to long-term and stable expression of the transferred transgene(s), and also because little effort is required for their cloning and production.

The result of phylogenetic studies is a hypothesis about the evolutionary history of taxonomic groups: their phylogeny. 
Phylogenetic analysis examines small differences in HIV’s genes using computational methods to calculate the genetic distance between strains. Unlike
human DNA, which remains stable for a lifetime, HIV’s RNA changes very rapidly, leading to a huge amount of genetic diversity. This diversity means that scientists, using phylogenetic analysis, have been able to ascertain where HIV comes from, as well as track the various strains of HIV that exist worldwide.

However, the mechanisms explaining oncogene addiction remain elusive. We propose that  addiction  may be an illusion generated as a consequence of differential attenuation rates of prosurvival and proapoptotic signals emanating from an oncoprotein acutely following its inactivation. According to this model, which we call  oncogenic shock,  prosurvival signals dissipate quickly on oncoprotein inactivation whereas proapoptotic signals linger sufficiently long to commit the cell to an apoptotic death.

Evidence from human and animal studies attributes BVT to alternating ectopic foci originating from the distal His-Purkinje system in the left and/or right ventricle, respectively.

786,List available biomedical question answering systems.,"We live in an age of access to more information than ever before. The exponential growth in the volume of publications in the biomedical domain has made it impossible for an individual to keep pace with the advances. Thus, there is a need for intelligent information retrieval systems that can summarize relevant and reliable textual sources to satisfy a user's query. Question answering is a specialized type of information retrieval with the aim of returning precise short answers to queries posed as natural language questions. This accentuates the need for fast and accurate biomedical question answering systems. In this paper we introduce INDOC -- a biomedical question answering system based on novel ideas of indexing and extracting the answer to the questions posed. Increased access to information allows for more informed and empowered researchers, while information overload becomes an increasingly serious risk. INDOC displays the results in clusters to help the user arrive the most relevant set of documents quickly. Evaluation was done against the standard OHSUMED test collection.

TRβ1 is shown to be coupled to the expression of SERCA in the heart
An  increase of TR expression in the hypertrophied heart has been show to result in  increased SERCA expression.
Inhibition of TRα1 by dronedarone does not change the expression of SERCA in the heart
Findings show that  SERCA 2 gene expression  is regulated  by TR  isoform-specific interactions with transcription factor (MEF-2) 
Hypothyroidism is accompanied by decreased expression of SERCA in the heart.   T3 increases expression of the cardiac SERCA

800,Elaborate on the association between Genomic Regulatory Blocks (GRBs) and target genes,"Genomic regulatory blocks (GRBs) are chromosomal regions spanned by highly conserved non-coding elements (HCNEs), most of which serve as regulatory inputs of one target gene in the region. The target genes are most often transcription factors involved in embryonic development and differentiation. GRBs often contain extensive gene deserts, as well as additional 'bystander' genes intertwined with HCNEs but whose expression and function are unrelated to those of the target gene. GRB target genes have properties that set them apart from their bystanders as well as other genes in the genome: longer CpG islands, a higher number and wider spacing of alternative transcription start sites, and a distinct composition of transcription factor binding sites in their core/proximal promoters.

816,Which are the main functions of the human HuR (ELAVL1) protein in fibroblasts?,"HuR is an RNA-binding protein that can stabilize labile mRNAs containing AU-rich elements in their 3' untranslated regions and has been shown to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm. HuR function was previously shown to be implicated in the maintenance of a ""young cell"" phenotype in models of replicative cellular senescence. Loss of HuR is linked to reduced expression of proliferative genes during replicative senescence. Importantly, overexpression of HuR in senescent cells restored a ""younger"" phenotype, while a reduction in HuR expression accentuated the senescent phenotype. HuR associated with the 3' untranslated region of the mRNA encoding the longevity and stress-response protein SIRT1, stabilized the SIRT1 mRNA, and increased SIRT1 expression levels. In mesenchymal cells HuR plays a dominant role in lung development and as a key post-transcriptional regulator of networks guiding tissue remodeling during branching morphogenesis. In fibroblasts knockdown of HuR decreased the endogenous expression of TGFβ1 under exogenous TGFβ1 treatment, simultaneously with the decrease of Col1a, Col3a and fibronectin expression.

821,Is K-63 linked protein ubiquitination related to proteasomal degradation?,"Ubiquitination is best known for its role in targeting proteins for degradation by the proteasome, but evidence of the nonproteolytic functions of ubiquitin is also rapidly accumulating. One example of the regulatory, rather than proteolytic, function of ubiquitin is provided by study of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor (TRAF) proteins, which function as ubiquitin ligases to synthesize lysine 63 (K(63))-linked polyubiquitin chains to mediate protein kinase activation through a proteasome-independent mechanism. Some TRAF proteins, such as TRAF2 and TRAF3, have recently been shown to have a positive role in the canonical pathway that activates nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) through IkappaB kinase beta (IKKbeta), but a negative role in the noncanonical pathway that activates NF-kappaB through IKKalpha. These opposing roles of TRAF proteins may be linked to their ability to synthesize distinct forms of polyubiquitin chains. Indeed, the TRAF2-interacting protein RIP can mediate IKK activation when it is modified by K(63) polyubiquitin chains, but is targeted to degradation by the proteasome when it is K(48)-polyubiquitinted by the NF-kappaB inhibitor A20.

836,Is there any functional association during viral replication between flaviviridae viral RNA depended RNA polymerase and viral helicase?,"Several labs have obtained evidence for a protein complex that involves many of the nonstructural (NS) proteins encoded by the virus. NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B appear to interact structurally and functionally. The interaction between the helicase, NS3, and the RNA polymerase, NS5B play a key role in viral replication. Pull-down experiments and surface plasmon resonance data indicate a direct interaction between NS3 and NS5B that is primarily mediated through the protease domain of NS3. This interaction reduces the basal ATPase activity of NS3. However, NS5B stimulates product formation in RNA unwinding experiments under conditions of excess nucleic acid substrate. When the concentrations of NS3 and NS5B are in excess of nucleic acid substrate, NS5B reduces the rate of NS3-catalyzed unwinding. Under pre-steady-state conditions, in which NS3 and substrate concentrations are similar, product formation increased in the presence of NS5B. The increase was consistent with 1:1 complex formed between the two proteins.",20,No answer generated,"[8396675, 17319152, 21249176, 15917225, 19555498, 22031952, 10668797, 9525637, 18004386, 31519749, 29768209, 19951725, 21957497, 32669294, 24992036, 22844102, 22365326, 23355615, 23157297, 22040846]","[15917225, 19951725, 22040846, 17660525, 17319152, 23157297, 18179252, 21946389, 21898331, 23463199]",5,10,0.5

888,Does replication timing affect the rate of somatic mutations?,"Mutation rate, as reflected in recent evolutionary divergence and human nucleotide diversity, is markedly increased in later-replicating regions of the human genome. All classes of substitutions are affected, suggesting a generalized mechanism involving replication time-dependent DNA damage. DNA repair systems, in general, are less efficient in late replicating heterochromatic regions compared to early replicating euchromatic regions of the genome.

Common pathophysiologic features of HF include changes in left ventricle structure, function, and neurohormonal activation. Disturbed myocardial calcium handling is also one of the pathophysiologic hallmarks of congestive heart failure. One of the hallmarks of chronic congestive heart failure is an increase in sympathetic tone to the peripheral circulation and to the heart. It has been proposed that the activation of neurohormonal pathways and the formation of oxygen free radicals ultimately lead to the activation of a family of transcription factors that are involved in cardiac and vascular remodelling which are hallmarks of congestive heart failure. Myocardial failure ultimately leads to exaggerated neurohumoral compensatory mechanisms and derangements of the peripheral circulation, which are the hallmarks of congestive heart failure. Two additional hallmarks of this syndrome are sodium and water retention.

915,Which are the biotracers used for detection of Alzheimer's disease using PET?,"Pittsburgh compound B (PIB) was the first radiotracer capable of highlighting deposits of beta-amyloid—one pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease—in living individuals during a PET scan. The Alzheimer's Association helped fund early PIB development. The Association in 2006 also awarded a $2.1 million grant to the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) to expand this long-term, nationwide study to include PIB-PET imaging.

18F flutemetamol (flute), another radiotracer that highlights beta-amyloid in a PET scan, is structurally identical to PIB except for one fluorine atom in place of a carbon atom. That small chemical change enables flutemetamol to remain stable significantly longer than does PIB, potentially increasing its usefulness outside research settings. In phase II study results reported in the Annals of Neurology, flutemetamol performed similarly to PIB. Additional testing is under way.

Florbetapir F 18 (18F-AV-45) is also a radiotracer that highlights brain beta-amyloid during a PET scan. At the 2010 Alzheimer's Association International Conference on Alzheimer's Disease (AAICAD), florbetapir's developer first reported data, later published in the JAMA, showing nearly perfect correlation between brain amyloid levels detected by florbetapir PET scans in study volunteers and levels found in autopsies of the same individuals a few months later. The developer has sought Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval to market florbetapir under the brand name Amyvid. The FDA has said it will withhold approval until the developer establishes a professional training program to ensure accuracy and consistency in reading and interpreting Amyvid scans.

Florbetaben (BAY 94-9172) is another radiotracer designed to detect beta-amyloid during a PET scan.

Physiological R-loop formation at CpG island promoters can contribute to DNA replication origin specification at these regions, the most efficient replication initiation sites in mammalian cells. One mechanism may be that downstream of a replication block, RNA at R-loops is extended by DNA polymerase I, opening up the DNA duplex and leading to the recruitment of the replisome. This would allow replication to proceed while the original block is repaired or bypassed. Thus, the organized structure of the R-loop is critical for primer RNA function in vivo with important implications for the RNA processing and DNA replication machinery.",20,No answer generated,"[16793409, 25972891, 25487262, 21979917, 8798672, 21129203, 19841062, 24164596, 25569209, 22195969, 16321966, 21441898, 11710514, 20729633, 31753851, 9119223, 24124207, 24598232, 23868195, 12732098]","[9009281, 22195969, 7774596, 19841062, 15569610, 22464441, 9150892, 21979917, 22965135, 21191184, 8798672, 21129203, 25487262, 10082645, 9119223, 25569209, 25972891, 20495385]",9,18,0.5

CTCF has a single paralogue, the testes-specific CTCF-like gene (CTCFL)/BORIS. CTCF and BORIS can be deregulated in cancer. The tumour suppressor gene CTCF can be mutated or deleted in cancer, or CTCF DNA binding can be altered by epigenetic changes. BORIS is aberrantly expressed frequently in cancer, leading some to propose a pro-tumourigenic role for BORIS. However, BORIS can inhibit cell proliferation, and is mutated in cancer similarly to CTCF suggesting BORIS activation in cancer may be due to global genetic or epigenetic changes typical of malignant transformation.",20,No answer generated,"[24657531, 21811597, 12191639, 23390377, 16140943, 16140944, 29385718, 9591631, 17962299, 23945083, 28862757, 22955980, 22709888, 21550623, 22952237, 26527277, 22829947, 20133600, 14980504, 23804403]","[21465478, 23390377, 21811597, 16140943, 16140944, 12191639, 24657531, 17962299]",7,8,0.875

972,What are the computational methods for the prediction of beta-barrel transmembrane proteins?,"Computational tools have been developed for beta-barrel transmembrane protein discrimination, topology prediction and prediction of their structural features.
Initial methods developed for the prediction of the transmembrane beta strands were based on hydrophobicity analysis, using sliding windows along the sequence, in order to capture the alternating patterns of hydrophobic-hydrophilic residues of the transmembrane strands, or using generalized secondary structure prediction methods. Other approaches included the construction of special empirical rules using amino-acid propensities and prior knowledge of the structural nature of the proteins, and the development of Neural Network-based predictors to predict the location of alpha-carbon atoms with respect to the membrane. During the last few years, other more refined methods, appeared, including: Neural Networks, Hidden Markov Models, Support Vector Machines, k-Nearest Neighbors, Radial Basis Functions, Bayesian Networks, Genetic Algorithms, Mahalanobis Discriminant Functions, Cellular Automata, N-to-1 Extreme Learning Machines. Hidden Markov Model-based methods are among the most successful in topology prediction, being able to capture the unique architecture of beta-barrel transmembrane proteins. Consensus methods, as well as pipelines of several related tools (e.g. subcellular localization prediciton, alpha-helical transmembrane protein prediction, signal-peptide/lipoprotein prediction) have also used for discriminating beta-barrel transmembrane proteins. Recently, a number of methods for predicting more detailed structural features (e.g. surface accessibility, residue contacts, even detailed atomic 3D models) tailored to beta-barrel transmembrane proteins have been developed, based on knowledge-based potential functions, graph theoretic models, physical models and multi-tape S-attribute grammars.

979,What is oprozomib?,"Oprozomib is a second-generation, highly-selective, orally administered proteasome inhibitor with promising activity against multiple myeloma.
Oprozomib directly inhibited OC formation and bone resorption in vitro, while enhancing osteogenic differentiation and matrix mineralization. Oprozomib increased trabecular bone volume, decreased bone resorption and enhanced bone formation in non-tumor bearing mice. Consequently, oprozomib seems to be able to effectively shift the bone microenvironment from a catabolic to an anabolic state and, similar to bortezomib, may decrease skeletal complications of MM.
Oprozomib effectively decreases multiple myeloma cell viability.
Oprozomib potently inhibit cell survival and induce apoptosis in HNSCC cell lines via upregulation of pro-apoptotic Bik. Upregulation of Mcl-1 by these agents served to dampen their efficacies. Oprozomib also induced autophagy, mediated, in part, by activation of the UPR pathway involving upregulation of ATF4 transcription factor. Autophagy induction served a prosurvival role.

In eubacteria, the NER system typically consists of UvrA, UvrB, UvrC, the UvrD helicase, DNA polymerase I, and ligase.  Damage recognition during bacterial NER depends upon UvrA, which binds to the damage and loads UvrB onto the DNA. Subsequently, UvrA, UvrB and UvrC form the excinuclease protein UvrABC endonuclease, a multi-enzymatic complex which carries out repair of damaged DNA in sequential manner. In some cases, Cho may be the effective nuclease for NER, rather than UvrC. UvrC nuclease and the short oligonucleotide that contains the DNA lesion are removed from the post-incision complex by UvrD, a superfamily 1A helicase. In gram-positive organisms, PcrA helicase can also displace UvrC and the excised oligonucleotide from a post-incision NER complex.",20,No answer generated,"[19933360, 14599769, 17893751, 10913608, 25463394, 8805338, 8972850, 20463888, 20004108, 20638914, 12509290, 16394029, 24290807, 9489705, 18270439, 14734564, 19617358, 14599741, 15913669, 21145481]","[25463394, 21145481, 22559785, 20004108, 19617358, 19933360, 19762288, 23963890, 24290807, 23245695]",6,10,0.6

They become part of the RNA-induced silencing complex and negatively regulate gene expression by binding to homologous 3'-UTR region of target protein-coding mRNAs as an imperfect match, causing translational repression or degradation. Approximately one-third of the protein-coding genes are susceptible to miRNA regulation. Accumulating evidence indicates that deregulated miRNA expression is associated with the onset and progression of a number of human cancers. Therefore, cancer-associated miRNAs (CA-miRNAs) could regulate target genes by acting either as ""oncogenes"" or ""tumor suppressor miRNA (TS-miRNAs)"".

However, some authors have failed to document beneficial value of venous angioplasty in MS patients and systematic review has suggested that there is currently no high level evidence to support or refute the efficacy or safety of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty for treatment of CCSVI in people with MS.",20,No answer generated,"[24975855, 23781006, 23235683, 22951366, 22577160, 20373339, 22155803, 21808631, 22569567, 23809937, 22311713, 23202144, 21839654, 21059535, 22687168, 21107001, 19958985, 22088659, 21679067, 21803799]","[22577160, 23034121, 23781006, 23809937, 23493652, 23402260, 21803799, 22155803, 22648477, 22311713, 21876515, 21839654, 23953830, 23419569, 21106999, 20351673, 23691321, 20351675, 21107001, 22687168, 21856578, 22951366, 19958985, 21059535, 22088659, 23701076, 23523158, 21679067, 23660636, 23948669, 20373339, 22569567, 23202144, 23443168, 22987234, 23235683, 23301864, 21487978, 22496109, 24975855, 24255092, 22640501, 21808631, 23249660, 23563645]",20,45,0.4444444444444444
